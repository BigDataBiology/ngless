# Releases

## Version 0.5

Released: 1 Nov 2017

**First release**. Supports all basic NGLess functionality. There may be some
rough edges, but it is suitable for production use.

Compared to pre-release versions (versions "0.0"), the `preprocess()` function
changed so that now it no longer modifies its argument in place.
