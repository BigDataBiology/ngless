# Releases

## Version 0.5.1

Released: 2 Nov 2017

Fixes [a minor issue in building a static
binary](https://github.com/luispedro/ngless/commit/e2320073e9cdc9a47ee045a4dea91ba952375c5b)
in 0.5.0.

## Version 0.5.0

Released: 1 Nov 2017

**First release**. Supports all basic NGLess functionality. There may be some
rough edges, but it is suitable for production use.

Compared to pre-release versions (versions "0.0"), the `preprocess()` function
changed so that now it no longer modifies its argument in place.
