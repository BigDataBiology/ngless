How to get in touch

### I have some questions comments

The best is probably the [user mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ngless). Both developers and
other users are there.

### I want to report a bug

The best is to report it using [Github
issues](https://github.com/ngless-toolkit/ngless/issues). This way, it will not
get lost even if everyone happens to be busy at the moment.

If you are not sure if it's a bug, feel free to ask on the [user mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ngless) first.

### I want to discuss the internals of development

There are two major channels for that:

- [Developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ngless-devel)
- [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ngless-toolkit/community)
