# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, but often it will be fruitful to first discuss it on [the
mailing-list](https://ngless.embl.de/contacts.html).

Generally, making all the tests pass is needed for a pull request to be accepted, although
sometimes a pull request can be in the form of a failing test (as a bug report). Note that
NGLess has a strong culture of strict backwards compatibility, so changing behaviour
requires (at the very least) discussion.

For all but the smallest changes, please list them on the `ChangeLog` and the
`docs/source/whatsnew.rst` files.
